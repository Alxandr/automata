# automata

automata is a instance manager for factorio. It enables easy installation of different
versions of factorio and setting up instances that maintain their own saves/mods/config.

Warning: Very alpha level software!
Currently only works on OSX, but getting it to work on windows and linux should be trivial,
if someone would like to try it out on either of these platforms, contact me through a github
issues we can work it out.
